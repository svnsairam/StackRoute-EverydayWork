                We believe everyone can be creative.
                 It’s not a rare or magical talent, 
                 just a mindset and a set of skills. We’re all born with curiosity, playfulness, and an ability to learn. As adults, we can choose to foster that creative spark and devote time to master the practical skills needed.
            </p>

                Why not develop your skills in code,
                 design & illustration, music, 
                 photography, game development, craft or more? Take that photo. Build that app. Write that song. Draw that picture. Invest some time in learning new skills and then go create something wonderful!
